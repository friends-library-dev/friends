      Permit the word of exhortation, upon a point wherein it seems to me you are in some
      danger—it is that of mixing up the pure, distinct, interior principle of faith in
      the gift of God, as an invisible and spiritual thing, only to be known, apprehended,
      believed in, felt, and obeyed, by the inward senses of the new-born creature—-I say,
      it is to be feared, that you mix and confound this precious, living thing, with the
      notional, historical knowledge, which is to be picked up from the letter that
      describes it.

  Mary Ann Kelty (1789-1873) was a teacher and author in England who appears to have
  discovered the writings of early Friends later in her life. Though she plainly shows
  herself to be in perfect accord with the principles and practices of the primitive
  Quakers, she lived in a time of great declension from the original purity and power in
  the Society, and probably for that reason, never formally joined with them in membership
  (though she is said to have frequently attended the Friends’ meeting house at Peckham).
  Her book “The Lives and Persecutions of the Primitive Quakers” is a very well-written,
  short history of the early Society of Friends, highlighting the most noteworthy figures
  and remarkable events of that time.

      Mamá y María, Conversando Sobre el Bien y el Mal En Seis Diálogos

    description:
      This short collection of dialogues between a mother and her young daughter was
      written by Mary Ann Kelty (1789-1873) in order to illustrate the necessity of
      identifying and uprooting the root of sin in children, before it grows strong and
      unyielding. “It is not,” says Kelty, “by lopping off the branches of corruption that
      the instructor of youth can hope to be of service,” but rather by helping them to an
      early and deep familiarity with the Light of Jesus Christ, that living “Word in the
      heart” which manifests all that is contrary to Truth, and gives power to become the
      children of God.
