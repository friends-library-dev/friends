#       About two years ago, to my humble admiration, in a season of great proving of spirit
#       it was so renewed and sealed to me (the inward attraction being so strong, and the
#       evidence so undoubtable) that [Catherine Payton] was a faithful follower of the
#       Lamb; for a language sweetly flowed through my mind, “I have chosen her and she is
#       mine”—so that I not only rejoiced, but was strengthened.
