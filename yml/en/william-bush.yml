  William Bush (1794-1844) was a ship carpenter on board a sailing vessel called the
  “Henry Freeling,” which was purchased by the Society of Friends and used by Daniel
  Wheeler in his missionary voyages to the islands of the North and South Pacific. Upon
  setting out from England, Bush was a man hardened by sin and rebellion, and captivated
  by the passing pleasures of this world. But through continued interactions with that
  eminent servant of the Lord, Daniel Wheeler, he says “my Redeemer snatched me from the
  claws of hell and brought me to the blessed Light of life.” This short publication gives
  an affecting account of a prodigal’s whole-hearted return to the Father, and includes
  much of the written correspondence that passed between these two men during the two
  years they were together at sea.

          Daniel Wheeler, the Friend who was so instrumental in the conversation and early
          spiritual instruction of William Bush, kept a journal of his own eventful life,
          in which he relates his dramatic change from a dissolute sailer to a humble
          disciple of Christ, and later in life chronicles his extraordinary missionary
          journeys to the various islands in the Pacific Ocean.
