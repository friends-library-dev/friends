  Joseph Hoag (1762-1846) was an honest and faithful minister in the Society of Friends at
  a time when multitudes were being drawn off the true foundation, both on the right hand
  and on the left. He stood firmly against the anti-christian innovations of Elias Hicks
  during the first great schism that the Society of Friends ever experienced. And some
  years later, he early detected and opposed the unsound views of Joseph John Gurney and
  his followers, believing (as it well proved) that adherence to these views would mean
  the eventual downfall of the society. In addition to having received a large gift in the
  ministry, Hoag was conspicuous for his prophetic giftings, whereby he was often enabled
  by the Lord to enter with great clearness into the particular state of both individuals
  and meetings. He also on some occasions received remarkable visions and dreams of things
  to come, not the least of which being his clear foresight of the coming civil war in
  America that would be fought between the northern and southern states.
