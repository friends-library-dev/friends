      Oh how He touches, softens, and humbles these proud, hard hearts of ours, these
      fallen, but aspiring natures, these froward, wayward tendencies; and woos us to be
      wise indeed, by learning of Him how to be simple as little children,—-submitting,
      bearing, and taking His yoke upon our spirits.

  Although John Barclay (1797-1838) was a descendent of the well-known apologist Robert
  Barclay, he was a complete stranger to the life and power of Truth until he began to
  seek the Lord with all his heart, somewhere around his 18th year. The Society of Friends
  at that time was in a low and declining state, but John Barclay dug deep and found the
  Root of life from which the early Quakers had sprouted, and in time became a living
  branch himself, and a very useful author and minister. He lived only 41 years, but his
  short life was wholly dedicated to his Master’s cause, and many of the journals,
  memoirs, and biographies of Early Friends that we possess now are the fruit of his
  arduous and faithful labor with the original documents.

      Before becoming a member of the Society of Friends, Alexander Jaffray (1614-1673)
      was the director of the chancellery of Scotland, a commissioner to King Charles II,
      the provost of Aberdeen, and a highly respected member of Oliver Cromwell’s
      parliament. His diary (discovered in a stack of papers in Ury, Scotland nearly 200
      years after its composition) candidly recounts his own inward and outward trials and
      experiences during a time of almost unprecedented political, military, and religious
      upheaval in the British Isles, and shows him to be a man of uncommon humility,
      sincerity, and piety from his earliest days. This publication is composed of two
      parts: the first being the diary of his life up to the time of his joining in
      fellowship with the despised people called Quakers in 1662. This is followed by the
      “Memoirs of the Rise, Progress, and Persecutions, of the People Called Quakers in
      the North of Scotland,” which also carries forward the narration of Jaffray’s life
      and sufferings for the gospel until his death in 1673.
