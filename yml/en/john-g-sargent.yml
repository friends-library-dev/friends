  Though an Englishman, John G. Sargent (1813 – 1883) spent much of the first half of his
  life living and working in Paris. His parents were members of the Society of Friends,
  but prior to his twenty-fifth year, he says, “I did not know the real foundation and
  essence of their principles, nor did I understand the leading of the Spirit.” When his
  heart was reached and his mind convinced by the Spirit of Truth, he gave up in
  whole-hearted obedience to follow the Lord and to wait upon Him in the way of His
  judgments. This he did faithfully for around eight years in France, though he frequently
  sat alone in the meeting house in Paris, often being the only person in attendance both
  Sundays and Thursdays. Upon returning to England in 1844, his heart was broken at seeing
  the sorrowful departures in doctrine, practice, and discipline that were rapidly gaining
  ground in the society, and according to the gift bestowed upon him, he endeavored to
  lift up his voice against the various innovations imposed upon a people who had been so
  preeminently raised up to show forth the purity and spirituality of the Gospel
  dispensation.
