    text: >-
      It is a precious thing to know what the cross of Christ is, and how to take it up
      and make use of it; for indeed, it is no less than the power that crucifies sin, and
      saves from it. Of this power Christendom is generally ignorant, having set up
      something else in its stead, and so sin remains alive, uncrucified, and salvation is
      lacking.

  William Shewen (1631–1695) was an early member of the Society of Friends who lived in
  London. He does not appear to have been a traveling minister in the society, but was a
  valuable author and a man known for his deep experience and understanding of both the
  work of God in the inner man and the attempts of Satan to hinder it. This publication,
  Meditations and Experiences, is a collection of paragraphs and short treatises, penned
  throughout Shewen’s life, describing his own openings and experiences of important
  subjects such as the light of Christ, the kingdom of God, waiting upon the Lord, and
  overcoming sinful thoughts and imaginations.
