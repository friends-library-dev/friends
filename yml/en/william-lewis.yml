    text: >-
      Nothing can preserve you but a single eye to the glory of God in all your thoughts,
      desires and purposes, and an entire dependance upon the quickening, cleansing and
      illuminating grace which is in Christ Jesus. Without this grace, we can do nothing
      that can kindle or keep alive one spark of heavenly life, or wash the stain of sin
      from our immortal souls. And without this single eye, the heart is ever divided and
      unstable, our faithfulness is as the morning cloud that goes away, and we will have
      no capacity to receive that shining which makes “the whole body full of light.”
description: >-
  William Lewis (1753 - 1816) was convinced of the truth as a young man, and made a
  sincere resolution to follow Christ in a self-denying life. But when the light that had
  previously visited him with sweet drawings, later allured him into the wilderness and
  showed him the desert land of his own heart, “the painful conviction quickly ensued,” he
  relates, “of being in reality wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked.” And because
  the Seed of life was not yet sufficiently rooted in his heart so as to enable him to
  patiently endure tribulation, he sadly drew back, fell into great despondency, and for
  some years sought comfort and distraction in lying vanities. But when at thirty-six
  years of age he was visited with a severe illness, and left to his own thoughts and
  reflections on his past course, he was mercifully convinced that there was no hope of
  finding the path of peace except by turning with full purpose of heart unto Him from
  whom he had so deeply revolted.
