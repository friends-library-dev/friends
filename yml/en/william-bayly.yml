  William Bayly (1629–1675) was a seeker of God from his youth, and one who clearly saw
  “that all the religion in the world was but as a fading leaf when it lacked the pure
  life and power of God which saves from sin, and brings into unity with Him.” Having for
  a time sought the living Truth among dead ceremonies and empty words, he was at length
  reached by the power of the Spirit and became intimately acquainted with God’s covenant
  of life and light in His Son, Jesus Christ. He is said by those who knew him best to
  have been a man of an innocent and blameless life, whose conduct adorned the gospel in
  every sense, and whose words administered grace to the hearers. Like Apollos, “he was an
  eloquent man, mighty in the Scriptures,” being well acquainted with both the history and
  mystery of the oracles of God, through the assistance of that Spirit which gave him a
  true understanding of both.

      William Bayly’s zeal for God and His blessed truth was known to many witnesses; for
      as he was a true son of thunder, to beat down deceit and falsehood, so was he also a
      son of consolation, to comfort the weak and tender. Indeed, he had a way to thresh
      the proud mountains till they became as dust before him; and yet at the same time,
      with his arms he would take up the meek and lowly, and bear them as in his bosom.
