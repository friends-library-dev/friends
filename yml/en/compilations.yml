  A few of our books were not written by a single person, but are collections of writings
  or letters from several different authors. Some of these books were compiled and
  published long ago by early Friends, and some were compiled more recently by the editors
  of this website.

      The full title of this work is, “Piety Promoted in a Collection of the Dying Sayings
      of Many of the People Called Quakers; With a Brief Account of Some of Their Labors
      in the Gospel, and Sufferings for the Same.” These four volumes extend over a period
      of more than one hundred and seventy years, and contain concise accounts of the
      godly lives and remarkable deaths of more than six hundred persons. Among these
      there is found a great variety in age, condition in life, station in the Church, and
      growth in spiritual knowledge and experience; but they all agree in a united
      testimony to the blessed effects of Christ’s reign in the soul, and to the
      consolation and support it furnishes on a death bed.

      testimonies in this work—taken from young persons between the ages of six and
      twenty-five—span a period of about 200 years and are a united and powerful
      confirmation of the importance of Solomon’s exhortation: “Remember now your creator
      in the days of your youth.”

      As a thin sapling, over the course of time, becomes a thick and immovable tree, so
      the fallen and sinful nature of man, left to govern itself, quickly grows stiff and
      hardened in all sorts of evils. How important, therefore, is it “for a man to bear
      the yoke in their youth,” (Lam. 3:27) that is, to learn and submit to the
      restraining and transforming power of the cross when the heart is still young and
      tender. “Sowing Seeds of Righteousness” is a collection of letters and short
      treatises written by ten early Friends that offers invaluable counsel to both
      parents and children on this critical subject.
