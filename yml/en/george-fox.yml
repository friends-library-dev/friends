  - source: Thomas Ellwood
    text: >-
      He was valiant for the truth, bold in asserting it, patient in suffering for it,
      unwearied in labouring in it, steady in his testimony to it; immovable as a rock.
      Deep he was in divine knowledge, clear in opening heavenly mysteries, plain and
      powerful in preaching, fervent in prayer. He was richly endued with heavenly wisdom,
      quick in discerning, sound in judgment, able and ready in giving, discreet in
      keeping counsel; a lover of righteousness, an encourager of virtue, justice,
      temperance, meekness, purity, chastity, modesty, humility, charity, and self-denial
      in all, both by word and example.
  - source: William Penn
    text: >-
      But above all he excelled in prayer. The inwardness and weight of his spirit, the
      reverence and solemnity of his address and behavior, and the fewness and fulness of
      his words, have often struck even strangers with admiration, as they often reached
      others with consolation. The most awesome, living, reverent frame I ever felt or
      beheld, I must say, was his in prayer. And truly it was a testimony that he knew and
      lived nearer to the Lord than other men; for they that know Him most, see most
      reason to approach him with reverence and fear.

  George Fox (1624-1691) is generally considered the founder of the Society of Friends
  (Quakers). As a young man, Fox could find no rest in the lifeless, outward Christianity
  of his day, seeing clearly that most believers professed far more than they truly
  possessed. This journal tells the story of his desperate search for the Truth, his
  discovery of a Christianity that stands in the life and light of Jesus Christ, and the
  ensuing fifty years of powerful ministry that turned the world upside down. This is the
  complete and unabridged Journal of George Fox, originally compiled and edited by Thomas
  Ellwood in 1694, and later divided into chapters, and supplied with numerous historical
  and biographical notes by William Armistead in 1852.

          In her book The Lives and Persecutions of the Primitive Quakers, Mary Ann Kelty
          recounts the first dealings of the Lord with the young George Fox, and
          faithfully describes how God made use of this unschooled man to gather together
          a society of Christians that exemplified true “obedience of faith.”

      The Epistles of George Fox is the unabridged collection of his 420 letters, general
      epistles, and testimonies, written over the course of his long and fruitful life.
      Some of these were addressed to particular individuals or ministering Friends, but
      the majority were written to the church at large, or to specific meetings of the
      Society of Friends in places like England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, America,
      Holland, and the Caribbean Islands. In his introduction to this publication, George
      Whitehead strongly recommends “the serious reading and perusal of the ensuing
      collection, as containing much Christian counsel to the many and various states and
      conditions of enlightened and enlivened souls, who are traveling and breathing after
      God.” Volume 1 of 2 (also originally published as volume 7 of the 8-volume “Works of
      George Fox”).

      Although the journal of George Fox is certainly his most well-known publication, in
      the course of his long and fruitful life Fox also wrote a large quantity of
      doctrinal writings touching upon all sorts of important Christian principles and
      practices, and explaining from Scripture the ancient path of truth and
      righteousness. In the three volumes of his collected doctrinal works, there are
      extensive writings on subjects like the kingdom of God, the true church and
      ministry, election and reprobation, the old and new covenant, the light of Christ,
      persecution, baptism and the Lord’s supper, the great apostasy, the cross of Christ,
      and much more. This particular publication is the first of his three doctrinal
      books, and is also volume four of the eight-volume “Works of George Fox.”

      As the preaching of George Fox and other early Friends continued to gain ground in
      England, Ireland, and Scotland in the mid-seventeenth century, a large number of
      religious leaders of various denominations (some from malice and others from
      misunderstanding) began to publish books that were critical of the Quakers and their
      doctrines. “The Great Mystery of the Great Whore” (originally published as volume
      three of the eight-volume “Works of George Fox”) is a large collection of Fox’s
      answers to the specific objections, slanders, and accusations that were published
      against Friends, together with instruction and encouragement for all sincere seekers
      of truth to come out from the various man-made and man-centered religions that
      comprise “mystery Babylon, the mother of harlots.”
