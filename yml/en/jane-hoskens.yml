  Jane Hoskens (1693-1764) was born in London and strictly educated in the profession of
  the Church of England. Though she often “slighted the blessed reproofs of the Holy
  Spirit of Christ” in her early years, after a serious bout of sickness that brought her
  near unto death, she was awakened to her spiritual condition and made willing to
  dedicate herself the to Lord’s service. Feeling it required of her to leave England for
  Pennsylvania, she there became acquainted with the Society of Friends, and was soon
  convinced that true Christianity was a work of God that must begin in the heart, and
  there be carried on by an unconditional surrender to the power of divine grace.
