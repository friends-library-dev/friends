  In the first half of the nineteenth century, great numbers of those who claimed
  membership in the Society of Friends in England were departing from the principals and
  practices of the early Quakers, and particularly from a total dependence upon the Spirit
  of God for all acceptable ministry, worship, and inward transformation. Sarah Lynes
  Grubb (1773-1842) was called to the work of the ministry when only seventeen years of
  age, and for fifty-two years was used by the Lord as a powerful prophetic voice to a
  backsliding people, often calling them back from a formal, intellectual, and lifeless
  Christianity, to the power and purity that was so conspicuous in the early days of the
  society. At thirty-two years of age, she destroyed some journals which she had
  previously kept, because of a growing concern that “no honor might be given to the
  creature.” But a large selection of her letters were collected by her children after her
  death, and are here published for the benefit of all who aspire to walk, as she did, on
  the ancient path.
