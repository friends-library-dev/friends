  Although there are many excellent and interesting journals published by Friends that
  relate the spiritual progress and ministerial labors of eminent men and women of God,
  there are very few publications that are similar to this one. Mary Waring (1760-1805)
  was neither a minister nor a public figure in the Society of Friends, but was rather a
  private, almost obscure individual, even in her native land. She never married or moved
  from the home her parents, and her diary relates little more than what are generally
  considered the common and daily duties of a private life. But what is truly remarkable
  about this unassuming woman, and what will no doubt be inspiring to all sincere readers,
  is the way she ordered everything in her life with a single eye to her Maker, constantly
  and faithfully considering whether every little act, word, disposition, or practice was
  pleasing to Him.
