  William Reckitt (1706-1769) was born in Lincolnshire to honest parents, both of whom
  died when he was very young. When an adolescent, serving as an apprentice to weaver, he
  was convinced of the Truth through the ministry of a Friend on a religious visit, and by
  diligently harkening to the Light of Christ that shined in his heart, he was preserved
  from the many temptations to which unguarded youth are commonly exposed. In 1742, at the
  age of thirty-six, he first came forth in the work of the ministry, and in 1756, when en
  route to America, he and several others on board were taken captive by a French
  privateer and brought to Morlaix. There he was detained in a painful state of captivity
  for about six months, but was preserved throughout in remarkable quietness and
  resignation, to the great admiration of some of the French inhabitants.
