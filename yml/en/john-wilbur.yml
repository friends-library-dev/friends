  Perhaps more than any other Friend in the nineteenth century, John Wilbur (1774-1856)
  labored and suffered to uphold the original principles and testimonies of the Society of
  Friends (as held and maintained by George Fox, Robert Barclay, Isaac Penington, etc.) at
  a time when multitudes were fast abandoning the faith of their worthy predecessors.
  Though naturally averse to controversy and conflict, Wilbur labored tirelessly in word
  and in writing to stop the propagation of those principles that he clearly saw would
  lead out from a living experience of the indwelling Christ and back into a crossless
  religion of words. Though loved and admired by the faithful in his day (like John
  Barclay, Sarah L. Grubb, Daniel Wheeler, etc.), he was persecuted by many members of his
  own society and eventually disowned by his yearly meeting. Having abandoned its solid
  foundation, the Society of Friends continued to “mix with the nations” and soon fell
  into a lamentable state of ruin, but the name John Wilbur came to be forever associated
  with original Quakerism, and with the small band of worthies who held on till the end.

      I know of no one in these latter days of trouble in our Society that has had so deep
      baptisms to pass through as you have. Oh, my dear friend, as you are so thoroughly
      converted, go on and strengthen your brethren; yes speak often to them and one unto
      another, and the Lord who has been your helper will hearken, and a book of
      remembrance will be written before Him.
