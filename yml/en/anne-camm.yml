    text: >-
      I have both a sight and sense of eternal rest with God in the world to come; and
      therefore, I labour hard to be swallowed up in immortal life, and to be made
      possessor of that rest which cannot be disturbed, where sorrow will cease forever. O
      my soul!—this is your glorious portion, therefore bless the Lord and wait patiently
      His appointed season.

  As a young woman, Anne Camm (1627-1705) connected herself with the Puritans, from an
  apprehension that they were the most pious and consistent among the professors of
  Christianity. But being desirous of finding a more perfect way, she joined herself to a
  company of sincere seekers, some of whom were convinced by the powerful preaching of
  George Fox, at Fairbank Chapel, in the year 1652. Coming thereby to more fully
  understand and experience that baptism which is with the Holy Spirit and fire, Anne and
  her husband Thomas (1641-1707) became valuable laborers in the Lord’s vineyard, freely
  sacrificing their time and substance, the comforts of home and each other’s company, and
  enduring many hardships and bitter sufferings for their testimony to the Truth.
