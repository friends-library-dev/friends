  Raised in communion with the church of England, Alice Hayes (1657-1720) was brought to
  the knowledge of the living Truth in the twenty-third year of her age through the
  powerful ministry of Elizabeth Stamper. Because of her unwavering commitment to the
  Lord, she suffered a variety of hardships at the hands of close relatives, and was
  threatened with abandonment by a husband whom she “loved as her own life.” But,
  believing Christ’s words that “he who loves anything more than Me is not worthy of Me,”
  she clung faithfully to His cross, and in time experienced His hand to overcome her
  inward and outward enemies, strengthening her in the midst of her trials, and eventually
  making use of her as an instrument in the Lord’s hand to gather others who groaned under
  Egyptian bondage.
